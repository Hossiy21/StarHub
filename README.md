## 🎨 Design Philosophy

StarHub follows a "Professional Deep Indigo" design language. We avoided the "neon-AI vibe" in favor of a grounded, high-contrast aesthetic that feels like a production-ready developer tool. 

- **Dark Mode:** Features the "Astral Glass" effect—translucent elements over a deep obsidian canvas.
- **Light Mode:** A minimalist, airy grid-based layout inspired by modern developer portfolios.

## 🔒 Privacy

StarHub is private by default. We do not store your GitHub data on any server. All scanning and organization happen client-side or via ephemeral API routes, ensuring your curation remains your own.
